# Muqrakr 2.0
Re-doing the Muqrakr project using different programming languages and technologies

## Project Description
Muqrakr is a political campaign finance search tool. It uses the ProPublica Campaign Finance API to retrieve financial info for political candidates and political campaign committees. It can even retrieve data on lobbyist contributions.

A user can create a profile and save searches to their profile which can be downloaded to a CSV for further data analysis.

Eventually, the project will also be able to search for the voting records and information on members of Congress using the ProPublica Congress API.

## Why make this site?
I wanted to allow people to have a very simple search tool for looking up campaign finance information on their elected officials. Transparency and accountability will make for better government and that starts with following the money.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Node maybe with Express
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- ProPublica Campaign Finance API and maybe the Congress API
